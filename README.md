# reverse-generation-of-.sql-file-based-on-.db-file
这是一个基于sqlite3的.sql文件逆向生成的程序，即输入.db文件可以输出其对应的包含SQL语句的.sql文件。其最初是作为一个数据工程的课程作业。在其中实现了基本的数据库检错、二进制表项的处理等功能，在运行速度上得到了一定的检验。
This is a program that reversely generates .sql files based on sqlite3, meaning that by inputting a .db file, it can output the corresponding .sql file containing SQL statements. It was originally developed as a course assignment for data engineering. It implements basic database error checking, binary table entry processing, and other functions, and has undergone certain tests regarding its running speed.
